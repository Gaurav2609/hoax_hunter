Several iconic Australian venues have appeared in a recent (IS) terror group propaganda video.  The video shows confronting images of beheadings, corpses and missiles in the Middle East before cutting to a shot of Melbourne's cityscape, Xinhua news agency reported.  The Melbourne Airport, a Qantas passenger jet, Flinders Street Station and St.Paul's Cathedral appear in the video just after a shot of a mosque being blown up.  Counter-terrorism authorities said they were aware of the video but not of any direct threats to Melbourne.  Michael Keenan, Australia's Minister for Justice and Minister said the security measures in place in Melbourne were world class.  "All Australians and Victorians in particular should feel very confident that our efforts are doing what they're required to do and that is keeping our country safe from this fanatical terrorism organization," Keenan said on Friday.  A spokesperson for Victoria Police's counter-terrorism command said the video was "similar in content" to material that had previously been released by IS.  "While such materials are disturbing, Victoria Police is not aware of any direct threat to the Victorian community or infrastructure at this time," the spokesperson said.  --IANS  ksk
