Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) on Saturday said it would form a 'human chain' on November 24 protesting against the Centre's "haste" in implementing demonetisation and the state government for "not taking any action" in addressing people's grievances.  "Because of the haste in implementing the demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, and the sudden decision made (by Prime Minister Narendra Modi) on November 8, there is no end to the difficulties being faced by the people," Chief said.  The poor and common people were standing in queues for long hours to exchange the now defunct notes while traders were facing a loss of business, he said.  "Prime Minister Modi has not replied to all the parties debating the issue in to solve people's problems. While other Chief Ministers are strongly condemning the move, the state government has not taken any action," he said in a statement.  Therefore, to "condemn Central and state governments," and press the Centre to make a suitable announcement to mitigate people's problems, the will hold state-wide human chain protest on November 24 between 4-5 pm, he said.  The respective district secretaries of the party will lead the protests, Karunanidhi said, and urged people, traders and workers to join the protest.
