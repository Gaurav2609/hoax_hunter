The Employees' Organisation (EPFO) has asked its field offices to settle death claims within a period of seven days from the date of receipt of proposal and retirement claims on the day of retirement.  Last month during the PRAGATI review meeting, Prime Minister had desired that claims related to death cases be prioritized and expedited and retirement claims may be settled on the day of retirement.  In a release, the Labour Ministry said officials at facilitation centres of field offices have been instructed to scrutinize the claims and guide the claimant regarding submission of required documents in appropriate shape.
