The on Friday refused to stop high courts from entertaining petitions challenging the Centre’s demonetisation notification saying that people were seriously affected and doors of courts cannot be shut in a situation which “may lead to riots”.  While dubbing the long queues outside banks and post offices as a “serious issue”, the apex court expressed its reservation on the Centre’s plea seeking a direction that no other court in the country should entertain petitions challenging the November 8 notification. “It is a serious issue which requires consideration,” a bench comprising Chief Justice and Justice A R Dave said, while asking the parties to be ready with data and other issues in writing.  “Some measures are required. See the kind of problems people are facing. People have to go to the high court. If we shut them from going to the high court, how can we know the magnitude of the problem? People going to different courts indicates the magnitude of the problem,” the bench said.  Attorney General (AG) Mukul Rohatgi submitted that any matter relating to the demonetisation issue should be heard by the apex court only. However, the bench said, “People are affected and they have the right to approach the courts. People are frantic. There may be riots.”.
