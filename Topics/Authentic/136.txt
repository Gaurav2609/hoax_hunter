Urging the government to explain why the exchange of has been stopped for a day, Chief Minister termed it as a "whimsical" decision and said a financial emergency has been imposed on the country.  "Now note exchange stopped for a day. Yet another whimsical decision. Government must explain. Is there currency shortage? Financial emergency," Banerjee said in a tweet.  Indian Banks' Association (IBA) on Friday said in Mumbai that all will serve only their respective customers on Saturday (tomorrow) and will not exchange old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes from customers of other banks.  Chairman Rajeev Rishi, however, said senior citizens are exempted and they can go to any bank branch to exchange notes on Saturday (tomorrow).
