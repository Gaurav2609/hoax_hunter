As consumers continue to queue outside banks and automated teller machines (ATMs) to withdraw cash, plastic money has come to their rescue. With no or limited cash in the wallet, consumers have been swiping their debit and credit cards even for small-value transactions.  Rajiv Anand, retail banking head at Axis Bank, says: “We have seen that the usage of debit cards has doubled and so has the increase in usage of point-of-sales (PoS) terminals.”  has also seen the usage of its debit card doubling. Bankers also say they have seen a significant increase in several first-time consumers, who had earlier never used their debit cards at machines.  An official said in terms of volume of transactions, the usage of debit cards had risen fourfold and in value by three times. “Earlier, we would get 3,000-4,000 requests for terminals a month. Now, we get an equivalent number every day,” said the official.    Bankers explain they are seeing a lot of demand for terminals, not only from merchants but from the smaller self-employed segment - doctors, chartered accountants, vegetable vendors, beauty salons, etc.  “We have seen a sharp increase in request for terminals but are constrained by the number of sales staff who can deploy it. Despite that, we have seen an increase in deployment of terminals by three times,” added Anand.
