Resuming at the overnight score of 103/5, Bairstow and Stoke survived the occasional scare to complete an 110-run partnership.  Star off-spinner caused plenty of trouble for the English duo on a pitch which does not have too much grass.  Stokes and Bairstow however, batted steadily to help the visitors reach a respectable total.  Umesh however, restored the morale within the Indian camp a couple of overs before lunch with a full length delivery that beat Bairstow with its pace and clipped the pads before sending the middle stump for a walk.  Bairstow scored 53 runs off 152 balls with five hits to the fence.  Ashwin trapped Stokes leg before shortly after the lunch break to hand the hosts a vital breakthrough.  Stokes 157-ball stay in the middle included 11 boundaries.  His departure saw England's first innings come to a rapid close as Ashwin and Jadeja removed the last three wickets in the space of just 30 runs.  Brief scores:  (first innings): 191/6 (Ben Stokes 70, Jonny Bairstow 53, Joe Root 53; 5-67) vs 455.
