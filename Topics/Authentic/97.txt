On February 26, the apex court had allowed Swamy to intervene in the pending matters relating to the title dispute with his plea seeking construction of Ram temple at the site of demolished disputed structure.  The BJP leader had earlier moved the plea for a direction to allow construction of Ram temple in at the disputed site and had mentioned it before a bench headed by Chief Justice for urgent hearing.  In his petition, Swamy had claimed that under the practises prevalent in Islamic countries, a mosque could be shifted to any other place for public purposes like constructing road, whereas a temple once constructed cannot be touched.  He had also sought directions to expedite the disposal of several petitions challenging the Allahabad High Court verdict of three-way division of the disputed Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid site in on September 30, 2010.
