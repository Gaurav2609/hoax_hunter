Ugly, fat double standard pig Biman Abbott, known for spouting socialism but wallowing in capitalism, was today appointed 'Shadow Home Secretary' - in clarification, Jeremy Carbuncle, leader of the faiL-abour party said - "well, we'll spend that long in the shadows as a political force, we may as well get a real shadow provided by this pig when it gets to hot for us attempting to be a real opposition".  He further went on to say "Well, Mrs May, I've just handed you a good couple of decades in power with this fekked up bunch of appointments - please may you give me 10p for a cup of tea".  Filth infested peadophile protectors the British Butt Club failed to open a 'comments' section on it's website because the backlash of the appointments would have made the Petabyte denial of service attacks against organisations recently seem like a bloke off the street telling someone 'you can't park there mate!'.  Fatty Abbott was too busy paying for her kids to go to private school because 'her heritage' people are better mothers than anyone else whilst stuffing her face full of caviar pies and champagne from a pint glass...to comment.  Menwhille, Shwarma Chakrkebabi was clapping her hands together and being in another role to spout tonnes of crap people will laugh at and or ignore.
