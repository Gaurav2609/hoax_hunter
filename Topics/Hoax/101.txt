London The Great British Bake Off's 82-year old Mary Berry is leaving the show. Fans are disappointed that listening to Ms. Berry talk about balls and sausages will no longer be an option.  "I learned so many things from Mary" spoke one of her many fans. "One of my favorites is that it's 'all in the wrist action.' It REALLY is!"  "Only Mary could help us visualize egg whites 'perfectly stiff.' And remarking on booze-filled doughnuts, only Mary would ask why they would bother with the doughnuts" spoke another viewer, sad to see Mary go.  Mary Berry, tired of hearing about her being a "ripe" old age for a berry, is returning to university to get her Ph.D in microwave technology.
