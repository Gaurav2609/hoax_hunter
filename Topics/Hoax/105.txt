An anonymous whistle-blower within the diplomatic service has today leaked a series of damning cables. The scandalous diplomatic communique makes reference the then secretary of state for business, innovation and skills Vince Cable brokering the sale of British made fiber optic cable to some of the world's cruelest dictatorships.  Kim Jong Un, Saddam Hussein, Robert Mugabe, the list of clients is endless, and reads like a who's who of unsavory world leaders, many of whom were under trade embargo for the military grade cables.  The plot thickens however, as we exclusively reveal that Vince Cable holds the controlling stake in the cable company in question, Cables cables - a fact he failed to declare to the Register of Members' Financial Interests.
