A school teacher from the village of Clackersford has found herself in hot water this week after allowing an unruly class of seven and eight year olds to watch a Chubby Brown video.  Following a major debacle in the classroom (B7), in which many of the children were running riot following a massive binge of pick in mix from the school tuck shop, the woman in question, Miss Smith, found herself at the end of her tether.  Breaking down in tears as posters of world maps and times tables charts were ripped from the walls, she found herself surrounded with cry's of 'we want the fat b*****d!'.  Looking frantically around the cupboards, Miss Smith finally found an old copy of 'Stocking Filler' at the back of a craft drawer, behind the PVA glue. Shaking as she removed it from its sleeve, she breathed a small sigh of relief as she rammed it into the VHS player. The children then proceeded to sit quietly and watch with delight at Chubby's rip roaring gags. Miss Smith then cleaned up the classroom, which looked like a bomb wreck.  A plea hearing is due at Clackersford Crown Court sometime soon.  Both teacher and school were unavailable for comment but we did manage to catch a word with Chubby in Lidl car park where he replied 'I don't see a f*****g problem!'
