The Tory Conference slogan suggesting that the Tories are working for a country that 'Works for Everyone' has been adapted for different audiences in the UK.  In more affluent areas the adaptation includes after the words 'Works for Everyone who has passed the 11+'  In areas of the North of England the final statement runs 'Works for Everyone who is not an Immigrant'.  In Scotland we have 'Works for Everyone who backs Brexit'  A mischief maker has even adapted the slogan so that is becomes: 'The Conservative Government is trying to give the impression that it cares about everyone but this only works if you are not disabled/poor or black.'  The best slogan from the Tory Conference is that the Tory Government works best for anyone who doesn't pay any tax.
