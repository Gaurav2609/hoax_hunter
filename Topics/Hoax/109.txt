LONDON STADIUM at Stratford: As the ongoing crisis continues at the athletics track that hosted the 2012 Olympics, even 'Duchess' Brady is losing her patience.  It is becoming clear now that Messrs Sullivan, Gold and DUchess Brady are losing sleep over the move from the Boleyn.  The Duchess of Knightsbridge was standing up singing the West Ham National anthem, whereupon she was manhandled out of the Stadium by the notorious Security personnel employed to jettison trouble-makers.  "I don't like this ph***ing new stadium, it was ill conceived and a total hell hole, give me the Boleyn Ground every day of week!"  Messrs Gold and Sullivan nodded in agreement and as Co Chairman of West Ham Utd, they made the following brief statement.  "We shall be making complaints about all this, to our MPs!"  With the capacity of empty seats having grown at the London Stadium and planned to grow even bigger and gargantuan, this will help West Ham Utd get to the next level!!
