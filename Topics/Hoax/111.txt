Lancashire County Council have agreed that fracking should not take place in their area of jurisdiction but democracy means that the views of Lancashire County Council are irrelevant.  This new concept of democracy is being promoted because it is in the interest of everyone that fracking should take place despite what the Council and residents of Lancashire want.  Promoting the new, exciting idea of Democracy, the Minister of Fracking, Savage Jagged, told our Fracking reporter John Witless, that 'The people of Lancashire needed to understand that their so-called democratic rights could not be allowed to undermine the democratic right of the Government to decide what democracy was.'  Witless then posed the possibility of a disaster resulting from the Fracking. 'That would not be the responsibility of the Government' commented the Minister 'it would be the fault of the Lancashire Council for not seeing sense in the first place. We can't Frack Democracy.'
