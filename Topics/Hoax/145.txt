Abu Sin from Saudi Arabia has been caught chatting on the internet by the Arabian culture police and will have his genitalia mutilated and mangled by court order.  An innocent poor little Arab kid is to have his entire life destroyed after the presiding judge ordered him to be publicly mutilated for his extensive list of sex crimes.  What he was doing:  Using his iPhone to make social media calls to America  Talking to an American  Saying nice things about her  Having a conversation  Trying to live his life like a normal innocent naive kid  Failing to abjectly capitulate to ugly nasty fanatics  What he was found guilty of:  Using his iPhone to organise an international sex ring  Not being a terrorist suicide bomber  Plotting the overthrow of the government  Plotting to to overthrow Islam  Having the misfortune to live in such a caring , liberal country  His defending lawyer appointed by the courts offered no defence and said the little punk deserved everything he got and was lucky that the judge was in a compassionate mood and he did not get a death sentence.  The judges scathing summation said it was time to stop all this corruption of youth by western debauchery and that if he uses his iPhone to talk to anyone again he will be summarily executed.  The judge said it was time to make Arabia great again.  A special squad is situated on the building opposite with snipers ready to fire as soon as they get the message he has violated the court order.  International Human NoRights Groups have responded with a very stern message, "Well it does seem a bit manifestly excessive, but everyone knows the cost of cyber-dating, especially with a Trump country".
