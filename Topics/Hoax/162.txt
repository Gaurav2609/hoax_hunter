One of Britain's most famous exports, singer/songwriter Adele, has decided to go public and warned pregnant mother's about having babies, she say's "being a mum aint no fun!"  Adele just happened to be paid a couple of million for telling her desperate story of post-natal depression to Vanity Magazine (appropriate), and now abortion clinics up and down the country are being inundated with pregnant mums hoping not to become like Adele, an over-weight, depressive, whinging patient.  Apart from Adele's weight, depression, alcohol and other slight problems, she has also told her adoring public, "stuff you all, I hate performing live because I'm scared stiff of you all! However, please keep buying my fabulous records, make me even more famous, but don't get near me you frighten the crap out of me!"  Well Adele, I wish you well in your future career and hope one day the world will forget how pathetic you really are whilst your fans keep begging for more of you misery music and miserable life, Amen!"  Amy Winehouse just got in touch with me via a medium (not Vanity) and asked me to tell Adele to stop f'ing whinging about her terrible life and warned her if they meet in heaven (or hell) she'll punch her f'ing lights out!
