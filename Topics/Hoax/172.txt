Los Angeles, CA After her TV show was put on hold following her harrowing robbery in Paris where she was tied up and robbed, Kim Kardashian began a new crusade.  "This incident really put the 'bare ass' in embarrassment" ranted Kim. "How could anyone see THIS ass and not rape it! I'm not saying that I wanted to be raped because I didn't but still, the media didn't need to emphasize that so much. And nobody emphasized that I was half-naked and no one ran half-naked pictures of me! I have a career to protect and I blame the City of Paris. That is why I have told my lawyers to start preparing a list and subpoenas for everyone in Paris" said Kim.  Paris had no comment.
