Science City, USA Donald Trump revealed, while visiting a science museum, that while he doesn't believe in a lot of Science things like Global Warming and Evolution and Gravity, he has hired some Science folk to create a super-suit for him. He thought of the idea while watching Iron Man on TV.  "If the American people are stupid enough to vote for Crooked Hillary over me, I must teach the U.S. a lesson for its own good. I will don my super-suit and wreak destruction everywhere except for Trump Tower and Howard Stern's radio studio. I've even picked a super-name for myself--the Orange Grabber" said Trump, not noticing there was a camera running and a microphone on.  "So for the sake of the U.S., I hope I don't lose that election."
