A clinical research study at the Upjohn Downjill University Think Tank has concluded a favorable opinion of oral sex.  A diverse collection of information was gathered stating that when asked about sexual gratification and where the subjects found it, Most agreed that Oral was the best, ranking 69% to the 32% for missionary, and the lowest percentage being given at .2% for "Pegging by Disney Midget behind the Chuck E Cheese in Orlando".  The study was conducted over a broad range of correlation data and has identified clinical prudish amongst conservatives but also clinical nymphomania and gay/curious tendencies in conservative Christian circles.  Over 20,000 people had been selected to to participate in the study from across the country. The Think tank has judged California, Texas, OKlahoma, Florida, and Michigan (especially the Mackinac Island region) to be the most original in getting your freak on and gratifying yourself in the most unusual ways.  Trampoline sex is the weirdest by leaps and bounds, but Oral sex still wins out by a head.
