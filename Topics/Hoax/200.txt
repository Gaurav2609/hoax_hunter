The release of the OceanX virtual reality goggles caused a stir in the gaming industry today when it was revealed that its visual display had better graphics than the human eye can process.  Described as the "Holy Grail" of virtual reality, the OceanX graphics have finally made virtual reality more realistic than actual reality. While some questions remain as to how this is actually possible and, if it is, what the point is, the gaming world has exploded in a frenzy for OceanX.  This reporter was privileged enough to watch someone use the new technology, and he is, or I am, shocked at just how realistic they presumably are. Unfortunately no-one was able to obtain an interview with the first user of the OceanX, who burst into vivid coruscating flames after turning the device on. After prophesising the downfall of civilisation in the voice of a thousand choristers, he collapsed into a pile of glowing ash.  Not that the bizarre yet hellishly painful death that awaits all users has dented their profit margins. In fact, JapanAir has announced that it will be opening a flight path directly to the Microsoft car park in Silicon Valley.  OceanX is expected to be available for commercial sale in the UK in early 2017, prior to the expected software update to reduce the risk of spontaneous combustion.
