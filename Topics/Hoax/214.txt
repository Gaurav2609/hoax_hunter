"I apologize for offending our native Americans. It was never the intention of the Washington football team to discredit or abuse these great people but in realizing that the inference exists I have decided to change the name of the Redskins"  So said Daniel Snyder owner of the National Football League's Washington Redskins in a press release posted this morning.  "I have chosen the new name to honor a group of immigrants that came to our country years ago and built our railroads and canals. A people that brought Rice-a Roni to San Francisco, a people that gave us the simple philosophy of the great Confucius who once said "no ticky no washy". I am proud to announce today the new name of our nation's capitol's National Football League team. The Washington Chinks!"
