Lionel Messi will escape any punishment for his childish outburst after his side were comprehensively beaten by Arab club Manchester City.  The Argentinean whinger was visibly upset when the referee refused to award Barcelona a penalty or send a opponent off as is usually the case when they play a English club.  Barcelona coach Luis Enrique explained:  "Leo didn't understand the referee's decisions. We all saw Sergio (Busquets) throw himself on the ground and roll around like he's been shot. Several times. This is normally the signal that thing are getting difficult and the ref should send a opponent off. What's the point on committing a bunch of tax fraud if we can't use the extra cash to pay off match officials?"  Messi continued his ranting as the two sides left the pitch and Lionel tried to confront two time FA cup winning and ex-Arsenal Captain and legend Mikal Arteta. Shrieking like a four year old girl being told she can't have a pony he reportedly said:  "Who do you think you are? We are Barcelona! No one beats us. No one! This doesn't count, where's UEFA? Where's UEFA?"  He was dragged away by security officials and given a warm bottle of milk to calm down.
