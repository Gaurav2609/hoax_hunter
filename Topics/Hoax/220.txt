Due to this Stokes believed he had missed out on several; vouchers entitling him to a free hotel stay , which he was going to use to get over the heartbreak of his beloved hound dog dying.  Stokes confronted the Elvis impersonator and reportedly told him "A little less conversation from you pal" and nutted him in the side of his head. But, as Blackburn fans can attest to, his aim was off and he had to repeat the attack several times before he scored. Erm hit him.
