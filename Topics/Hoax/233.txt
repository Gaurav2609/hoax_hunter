The great Manchester derby ended with The Special One not being so special whilst providing their noisy neighbors with special gifts that only Fools and Horses would give away.  However, in his defence, that resembled a Swiss Cheese factory, after 45 minutes of non-specialty, The Special One, did actually do something special by removing both of his Achilles Heels and replacing them with two pairs of feet resembling real special footwear!  The Chosen One, with whom who The Special One has had several past confrontations, chose to kill The Special One's attempts to spoil this feisty reunion of Special One's on a grey Manchester battlefield, and eventually saved his reputation of being a real Chosen One, not like the pretender, a Scottish moron, who is now applying his useless trade at a rather useless club somewhere in the Northeastern, wind blown frontiers of these once so great islands.  Anyway, Bravehearts win nothing special, only Special One's do, and the battle will continue between those Chosen and those Special until one or the other realises it is just a load of media-hyped up ball-shit as Donald Trump destroys the world and ISIS become a bunch of headless chickens, which they are!
