Ever since Twitter announced plans to cut its workforce, the birdies have been all atwitter, wondering if some of them will be losing their jobs.  "Hopefully not," said Bill Twitter, Head Bird of the Twitter Birdies labor union. "After all, it is these hard-working birdies who are the heart of the company. It's do-nothing executives whose jobs should be cut."  Mr. Twitter continued, "But my union members are not birdbrains, so they are considering different scenarios and making alternate plans. They're not flying off to an unemployment line, that's for sure."  He refused to elaborate, but rumor has it that under development is a sequel to Alfred Hitchcock's 1963 movie "The Birds." It would feature the Twitter birdies as well as actress Dakota Johnson, star of the movie "Fifty Shades of Grey" and granddaughter of Tippi Hedren, who starred in the original "The Birds."  The Twitter birdies are excited about the project, tentatively titled, "The Birds: @NextGeneration." They hope that it will come to fruition and be nominated for an Oscar.  They may even get a chance to fly the red carpet. Wouldn't that be a kick in the head to clueless Twitter execs?
