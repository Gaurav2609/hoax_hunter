With the wild success of Pokemon Go, a parody of the game called "Trumpemon" has already been released. At the same time, the makers of the parody are already being sued by Donald Trump in a California court.  Tellingly, Trump is suing for trademark infringement on the Trump name, not because of the actual content of the game.  In the Trumpemon game, players use augmented reality to catch Mexicans and Muslims who are held until their legal and ideological status can be determined. Women and children are worth less points, while ISIS members and drug cartel leaders score big points in the new Trumpemon game.  Crankco Ltd., the creator of the game, has succeeded where Trump has failed so far: Trumpemon players who are on the US/Mexico border will see a 65 foot virtual wall between the two countries on their mobile devices. This has led to speculation that Trump actually wants to buy out the company that made the app so that he could then claim he made good on his promise to build a border wall.  Ironically, Trump's lawsuit has put the small company, Crankco Ltd., in the spotlight, and the family run game app company has scored over 5 million downloads as of this writing.
