In a move that will surely mark the beginning of the New World Order, Amazon has purchased the entire state of Rhode Island to be its East side, western hemisphere distribution center.  Before the move the state used its power of Eminent domain to seize all property and structures within its border enabling Amazon to legally transform all things brick and mortar into warehouse space.  All business and jobs of any sort have been told to leave the warehouse immediately or be considered a squatter and be arrested by Amazon security. All people residing in the state have been offered jobs as pickers, drone operators, drivers, and management.
