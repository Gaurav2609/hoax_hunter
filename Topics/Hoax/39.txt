Reports have just surfaced of a gay affair between Donald Trump and Bill Clinton Apparently, The Donald grabs more than just pussies.  "Yes", confirmed Trump, "my tie has tested positive for Bill's DNA. Really, though, I just wanted to get the stain out before it got dry and crusty. The DNA test was just a freebie offered by my dry cleaner--and no, I don't use anyone's man-juice to slick my hair into place."  "Yep", confided Bill. "I handed fifty bucks to each of our Secret Service bodyguards so that they would look the other way. That was money well spent--best damned head I ever had! The Donald used his tie to wipe off his lips, but there ain't no wiping the grin off my face! Plus, I honoured my promise to Hillary not to cheat on her with another woman."  Presidential erections, indeed.
