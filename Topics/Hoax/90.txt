In an unprecedented, unexpected move to thwart Brexit negotiations and hindering Mrs May triggering article 50, 3 British judges have found a massive loophole!  It seems as though a hidden law found in the Magna Carta does not allow the British upper-class, royals and members of the legal fraternity wig wearers to purchase their wigs outside of Europe because of the fear of lice and other undesirable bugs hiding in the wigs!  Prince John, a wig wearer and total nutter, demanded that wigs could only be purchased from renowned German wig-making company, Dummkopf & Co, founded by Herr Dummkopf (logical), whose portfolio of clients includes Nutty King Ludwig, Martin Luther (the white one), Wagner (The Nazi) Goring (He was one too), Mozart, Beethoven, etc, etc!  The judges have been called "enemies of the people" by tabloids spreading their normal, slanderous, scandalous reports. However, the 3 judges are demanding that this ancient law must be implemented otherwise the price of their wigs will become too expensive because of import duty and German rascals pumping up the prices in Euro's as the GB Pound sinks out of trace!  They are demanding that parliament must stop Brexit negotiations immediately! They have also asked the Scots and Northern Irish to organise referendums so they can eventually purchase their wigs via Edinburgh or Belfast because Scots are determined to stay in Europe even if they have to rebuild Hadrian's Wall!  Nigel Farage's wig is wearing out rapidly, and being the mega-hypocrite that he is, ordered a new set of wigs from Herr Dummkopf, Made in Germany, before Mrs May eventually plunges the UK into an abyss that they will never get out of! Working class wig wearers don't give a wank because they wear cheap imitations from China and are only interested in cheap booze drying up in Calais!
