London, England The EPA (English Press Association) announced that the press is shocked that the Prince, Royal though he is, has the audacity to ask the press for more privacy regarding the women he dates.  "For hundreds of years the British publick, as downtrodden and miserable as they were, could at least obtain some titillation from the press reporting on the peccadilloes of the Royal Family. What Prince Harry is asking goes against the grain of the unwritten agreement between the Royal Family and the Press-you provide us with details of a fairytale life and we don't revolt and burn your castles."
