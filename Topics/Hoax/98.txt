Vanatu Many people don't realize that the Kastom people that are around Yaohnanen village, on the southern island of Tanna, in the island nation of Vanuatu, belong to a cargo cult devoted to Prince Philip!  While most people see him as just an ordinary, run-of-the-mill Prince and Queen Consort, the Prince is a revered, divine being to the Yaohnanen tribe on Tanna. Their most cherished possessions are pictures of Prince Philip.  Cargo Cults originated when inhabitants of far-flung regions saw others receiving cargo and wished to do the same by praying to the cargo deities. Hopefully, HRH Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, will keep sending appropriate cargo worthy of their worship!
